# Peep

Welcome to another website of mine, if you
are here I would guess you want to learn more about me. This website
will tell you a bit about my skills and personality, but there is always more to it.

This website's idea and concept were inspired by the work of Nicky case, specifically
the game "The Evolution of Trust". while the sode and artwork are still my original work

It's not just the content of the website that tells you who I am and
what I'm like, but also how I choose to present it.

This website isn't just pixels on the page telling you random facts about me.
This website is what represents me through my passion in web dev
